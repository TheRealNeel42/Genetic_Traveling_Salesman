# Salesman.py
This is a Python implementation of a homework assignment for CSC 4240 

## Usage
This is a very rudimentary example of a genetic algorithm to solve the Traveling Saleman problem.  
It creates a graph by reading the nodes and vertices in city_milage.txt and solved the problem with
a set population of 500 and in 500 generations.
